FlickMage

A javafx application(with a touch of swing) that offers Flickr image browsing and utility.

Structure:
	cache - this folder is used to cache downloaded images
	cache/metadata - is used to store metadata of downloaded images
	dist - application jar file
	doc - doxygen generated documentation
	resources/logo - logo images used within the application
	src/ - sources code
	
	use runApp.bat to easily run the app.
	
Prequisites: Have an internet connection and java installed. 
Usage: Browse for flickr using tags as search tool and clicking an image loads its metadata.
The circle near the tag search box shows working status (yellow means busy, you know what green means).

Enjoy!
